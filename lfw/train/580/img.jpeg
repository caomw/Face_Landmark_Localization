According to Variety, it&#39;s unclear what scenes have already been shot, though it seems most likely that the big action scenes were the ones shot first. Unfortunately, this is the more difficult scenario as it would be easy to fill Walker&#39;s action scenes with a stunt double, but far harder to fill the expository scenes with his character and other members of the cast without him. It&#39;s also unclear how this will affect the storyline and development, or how creative Wan and his writers might have to get in order to salvage the film. \u003C/p>\n\n<p>Walker also has two new films coming out within the next year, having completed Pantelion&#39;s (the Latin audience branch of Lionsgate) indie drama, <em>Hours\u003C/em>, about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, as well as Relativity&#39;s <em>Brick Mansions\u003C/em>, in which Walker is set to star with RZA. \u003C/p>\n\n<p>(Source: <a href=\"http://variety.com/2013/film/news/paul-walkers-death-raises-questions-for-future-of-universals-fast-and-furious-franchise-1200906732/\">Variety\u003C/a>)\u003C/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/alishagrauso\">Follow Alisha on Twitter.\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n"},"source":null,"ad_tags":{"channels":["action-movies","sequel"],"proj_ids":[264263]},"author":{"id":761298,"name":"Alisha Grauso","first_name":"Alisha","last_name":"Grauso","user_name":"Alisha","image_url":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/avatars/383872-6bd492d8-8e6e-4f42-9772-a31a9a81e0fc-Aviary_20Photo_130168321825574776.png","description":"Editor-in-Chief here at MP. 213 lbs. of snark in an 105 lb. body. @alishagrauso on Twitter.","movie_subscription_count":60,"followers_count":1390,"verified":"staff","user_subscription_count":15,"weekly_readers":52575,"contributions_count":1079,"profile_public":true,"cover_image":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/covers/383872-ed802e0e-47d0-498e-b0a6-6c5d154e7169-Aviary_20Photo_130187239554979906.png","facebook_id":"61901310"},"related_pages":[{"published_at":"2011-10-04T16:24:48+02:00","title":"Fast & Furious 7","banner_image":"http://d1fgn7wex1bhjn.cloudfront.net/assets/page_banner/1337699106_banner-image.jpg","banner_image_new":"http://d1fgn7wex1bhjn.cloudfront.net/assets/banner_image_new/1337699110_banner-image-new.jpg","movie_list_item_image":"http://d1fgn7wex1bhjn.cloudfront.net/assets/movie_list_item_image/1337699114_thumbnail-big-image.jpg","large_image":"http://d1fgn7wex1bhjn.cloudfront.net/assets/large_image/1337699119_banner-big.jpg","brightcove_id":null,"permalink":"fast-furious-7","facebook_mirror_id":null,"subscriber_count":18640,"theatrical_release_date":"2014-07-14","season_premiere_date":null,"id":264263,"facebook_id":null,"badge_image":"http://d1fgn7wex1bhjn.cloudfront.net/assets/page_banner/1337699106_banner-image.jpg","has_content":true,"discoveryline_enabled":null,"type":"movie","banner":{"large":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images/1341415466_1341415466_fast_furious7-ff.jpg","medium":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images/medium_1341415466_1341415466_fast_furious7-ff.jpg","iphone":{"retina":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images/w640_1341415466_1341415466_fast_furious7-ff.jpg","nonretina":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images/w320_1341415466_1341415466_fast_furious7-ff.jpg"},"narrow":{"x":149,"y":0},"wide":{"y":0},"square":{"extralarge":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images_square_big/1341415466_1341415466_fast_furious7-ff.jpg","large":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images_square/1360750313_medium_1341415466_1341415466_fast_furious7-ff.jpg","retina":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images_square/w192_1360750313_medium_1341415466_1341415466_fast_furious7-ff.jpg","nonretina":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images_square/w96_1360750313_medium_1341415466_1341415466_fast_furious7-ff.jpg","x":67}},"channel":{"id":267729,"type":"movie-channel","published_at":"2011-12-18T18:06:00+01:00","name":"Action Movies","movie_count":153,"series_count":0,"thumbnail_image":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/channel_images/ch_action.jpg","cover_image":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/covers/103-2fc3e7a5-12e5-41af-9ebd-5e63cb638140-action.jpg","icon":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/channel_images/ch_action.jpg","short_name":"","permalink":"action-movies","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Action/275898942440515","facebook_mirror_id":"184736191649925","description":"Boom!

To be honest, I&#39;m not entirely sure why, since so far we&#39;ve only seen a single trailer and snippet of additional footage.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>Luckily, <a href=\"http://moviepilot.com/people/95176-frank-grillo\">Frank Grillo\u003C/a>, who will play the villainous Crossbones in <em>Captain America 2\u003C/em>, is here to slightly elucidate the proceedings. In an interview with <a href=\"http://www.craveonline.com/film/interviews/609241-exclusive-interview-frank-grillo-on-homefront-captain-america/2\">Crave Online\u003C/a>, he further explained his role and the future of Crossbones. First, he described Ca<em>ptain America: The Winter Soldier\u003C/em> as an origin story for several new characters:\u003C/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It&#39;s an origin film. You meet people who are going to be around for a while, so they introduce the characters. It&#39;s almost like it&#39;s a series. It&#39;s fun. I can’t say very much about it because Marvel&#39;s very strict about what you’re allowed to say. The movie, we&#39;ve seen bits of it, and it is spectacular.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\n<p>The conversation then moved onto Crossbones future within the Marvel universe. When asked whether Marvel planned to add Crossbones to any future projects, Grillo responded:\u003C/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>They do actually. We&#39;ll see what happens. We&#39;ll see if the fans respond to Brock and how it goes.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\n<p>Marvel certainly has a reputation of jumping on characters which become surprise hits. Sure, people liked Loki prior to <em>The Avengers\u003C/em>, but surely it was his role in that film which secured him a larger part in <em>Thor: The Dark World\u003C/em>, and now talks of his own spin-offs.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>If Frank Grillo can make Crossbones a memorable character, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be seeing more of him in the future.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>What do you think? Are you excited to see him on the big screen? Let us know below.\u003C/p>\n"},"source":null,"ad_tags":{"channels":["sci-fi-fantasy-tv"],"proj_ids":[205406,753854,932254,958524,958562,958619]},"author":{"id":660999,"name":"Mark Newton","first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Newton","user_name":"mark","image_url":"https://graph.facebook.com/728703587/picture","description":"Writer, cynic, Walter Mitty day-dreamer.","movie_subscription_count":14,"followers_count":643,"verified":"staff","user_subscription_count":5,"weekly_readers":28368,"contributions_count":1377,"profile_public":true,"cover_image":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/covers/327896-c3dbb7a0-8876-4cc9-a1d5-38a199d2dea1-Banksy.jpg","facebook_id":"728703587"},"related_pages":[{"published_at":"2012-11-21T11:44:11+01:00","title":"Crossbones","banner_image":null,"banner_image_new":null,"movie_list_item_image":null,"large_image":null,"brightcove_id":null,"permalink":"crossbones","facebook_mirror_id":null,"subscriber_count":403,"theatrical_release_date":"2014-99-99-Estimated","season_premiere_date":"2014-99-99-Estimated","id":753854,"facebook_id":null,"badge_image":null,"has_content":true,"discoveryline_enabled":null,"type":"series","banner":{"large":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images/1353490379_crossbones-oo2.jpg","medium":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images/medium_1353490379_crossbones-oo2.jpg","iphone":{"retina":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images/w640_1353490379_crossbones-oo2.jpg","nonretina":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images/w320_1353490379_crossbones-oo2.jpg"},"narrow":{"x":445,"y":4},"wide":{"y":85},"square":{"extralarge":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images_square_big/1353490379_crossbones-oo2.jpg","large":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images_square/1360752289_medium_1353490379_crossbones-oo2.jpg","retina":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images_square/w192_1360752289_medium_1353490379_crossbones-oo2.jpg","nonretina":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images_square/w96_1360752289_medium_1353490379_crossbones-oo2.jpg","x":306}},"channel":{"id":719816,"type":"series-channel","published_at":null,"name":"Sci-Fi/Fantasy (TV)","movie_count":0,"series_count":109,"thumbnail_image":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/channel_images/ch-scifi.jpg","cover_image":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/covers/1561-3e8fc466-1533-4690-a07b-adf49647a14d-Gravitys2.jpg","icon":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/channel_images/ch-scifi.jpg","short_name":"","permalink":"sci-fi-fantasy-tv","facebook_url":null,"facebook_mirror_id":"","description":"The best science fiction and fantasy shows our TV channels have to offer get discussed  and reported on and right here, in the sci-fi/ fantasy TV channel.

The first (and currently only) movie in the franchise to actually somewhat stick to a comic-book plot was this year&#39;s acclaimed <a href=\"http://moviepilot.com/movies/34674-the-wolverine\" class=\"project\" data-follow=\"project:34674\">The Wolverine\u003C/a>, which was based on the classic comic run by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller of the same name. The second film that will more-than-nominally follow a comic-book narrative is the upcoming <a href=\"http://moviepilot.com/movies/203942-x-men-days-of-future-past\" class=\"project\" data-follow=\"project:203942\">X-Men: Days Of Future Past\u003C/a>. And now, judging from remarks director <a href=\"http://moviepilot.com/people/49914-james-mangold\">James Mangold\u003C/a> recently made, there will be a third one: the sequel to the Logan-centric <em>The Wolverine\u003C/em>, which for now we&#39;ll simply refer to as <em>The Wolverine 2\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>Mangold said in a recent interview, when asked if he will be drawing inspiration from any of the comics:\u003C/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Absolutely. I can tell you that I certainly have in determining where we are going that I&#39;m not solely relying on my own imagination but also the imaginations that have spun great stories about Wolverine in the comics.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\n<p>While he didn&#39;t name a specific book or author, he does appear to already have a particular story in mind. \u003C/p>\n\n<p>Mangold also reflected on the fact that, after the events in <em>The Wolverine\u003C/em> (where Logan and Yukio spend two years on a trip around the world before he reunites with Professor X and Magneto), he now has a perfect time gap to plug in a standalone sequel:\u003C/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I honestly have sketches and ideas, but there are many alternatives and that certainly is indeed a window that exists.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\n<p>And in an interview earlier in the month, <a href=\"http://moviepilot.com/people/51287-hugh-jackman\">Hugh Jackman\u003C/a>, who portrays the short-tempered Canadian on screen, teased fans with:\u003C/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was on the phone with Jim Mangold last night. There are some really cool ideas that I&#39;m dying to tell you, but that would be giving away a secret that isn&#39;t fully formed yet.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\n<p>What do you think?

Well, it&#39;s &#39;All Praise Joss Whedon Day&#39; again, as the prolific nerd-demigod has now confirmed that a well-known, well-aged Super Soldier&#39;s sequel will have a crossover in an upcoming Agents episode.

In this case, the episode will apparently air <em>before\u003C/em> the <em>Winter Soldier\u003C/em> premiere, thus setting up and teasing events in the film concerning the top-secret <strong>S\u003C/strong>trategic <strong>H\u003C/strong>omeland <strong>I\u003C/strong>ntervention, <strong>E\u003C/strong>nforcement and <strong>L\u003C/strong>ogistics <strong>D\u003C/strong>ivision. And if you&#39;re one of those skeptical people who wouldn&#39;t trust an anonymous source with a weather report (can&#39;t say I blame them), well, we&#39;ve now got confirmation from the Whedmeister himself that this crossover will, indeed, happen. Not only that, but the producers of the series have plans for more interaction with other franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. \u003C/p>\n\n<p>Whedon chatted with <em>TV Guide\u003C/em>, saying:\u003C/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We&#39;re trying to flesh out the world. The Marvel brand carries with it a lot of familiar faces. We&#39;re trying to flesh out the world of S.H.I.E.L.D. with the established characters and the characters we&#39;re introducing to build out the larger organization that we operate in.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/embedded_images/1385117327_aven.jpg\" class=\"center\" >\u003C/p>\n\n<p>On the subject of <em>The Winter Soldier\u003C/em>, specifically, Joss had this to comment:\u003C/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nick Fury [<a href=\"http://moviepilot.com/people/47248-samuel-l-jackson\">Samuel L. Jackson\u003C/a>] is in that one, and S.H.I.E.L.D. makes an appearance, so we will definitely try to tee-up some stuff and probably play a little bit of the fallout from that film. We’re hoping to do some cool stuff.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\n<p>No doubt about the coolness of it, sir! It&#39;s also worth noting that <a href=\"http://moviepilot.com/people/49351-scarlett-johansson\">Scarlett Johansson\u003C/a>, who plays the most beautiful spider-based-name Avenger ever, asserted during Comic Con that the Captain America sequel was as much of a S.H.I.E.L.D. movie as a First Avenger one. In the comic books, of course, the fates of the Agency and &#39;Winghead&#39; (hmm, can&#39;t really call him that in the screen version, unfortunately) have been strongly intertwined for decades.\u003C/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/embedded_images/1385117358_cap1.jpg\" class=\"center\" >\u003C/p>\n\n<p>What do you think?

Abrams\u003C/a>&#39; production company, Bad Robot, <a href=\"http://moviepilot.com/stories/1046057-are-these-the-star-wars-episode-vii-scripts\">tweeted a pic of a script\u003C/a> that many speculated was the finished script for <a href=\"http://moviepilot.com/movies/711158-star-wars-episode-vii\" class=\"project\" data-follow=\"project:711158\">Star Wars: Episode VII\u003C/a>? Pictured above, it was a pretty slick-looking piece, with red pages sandwiched between black covers with the Bad Robot logo embossed upon them. \u003C/p>\n\n<p>London-born actor <a href=\"http://moviepilot.com/people/48465-jason-flemyng\">Jason Flemyng\u003C/a> (<em>X-Men: First Class\u003C/em>, <em>Clash of the Titans\u003C/em>) seemingly confirmed those rumors with a pic he recently posted to his <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/g5pnZFrCtw/\">Instagram\u003C/a> (which has since been taken down), depicting a crumpled red script page with his name emblazoned across it being held down with a glass of Stella Artois, along with the following caption:\u003C/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pint of Stella and Star Wars script! That’s me sorted till 5!\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/embedded_images/1385049931_star-wars-red-script.jpg\" class=\"center\" >\u003C/p>\n\n<p>To make it clear, Flemyng has not been given a role and is simply going through the auditioning process at this point, but he appears to be fairly far along enough in the process so as to have gotten a partial script with his name on it. You do have to wonder if him leaking this pic hurt his chances, however. He may have thought better of posting the image and promptly deleted it, but it&#39;s more likely that he was contacted by a Lucasfilm/Disney rep and told to remove it. Ballsy? Over-excited? Stupid? All three? I mean, if I were auditioning for a <em>Star Wars\u003C/em> film, I&#39;d be running around making lightsaber noises while shouting it from the rooftops, but still, it&#39;s kind of a facepalmy &quot;derp&quot; moment from a veteran actor. \u003C/p>\n\n<p><em>Star Wars 7\u003C/em> isn&#39;t hitting theaters until December 18, 2015, but we&#39;ll start hearing confirmed casting relatively soon. Let&#39;s see if Flemyng makes the final cut. \u003C/p>\n\n<p>(Source: <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/g5pnZFrCtw/\">Instagram\u003C/a> via <a href=\"http://comicbook.com/blog/2013/11/20/star-wars-episode-7-script-page-leaks-online-jason-flemying-auditioning/\">Comicbook.com\u003C/a>)\u003C/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/alishagrauso\">Follow Alisha on Twitter.\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\n<p>[[poll]]\u003C/p>\n"},"source":null,"ad_tags":{"channels":["sci-fi-movies","popular-movies","space-opera"],"proj_ids":[711158,931759,958524,958545,958562,958619,959385]},"author":{"id":761298,"name":"Alisha Grauso","first_name":"Alisha","last_name":"Grauso","user_name":"Alisha","image_url":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/avatars/383872-6bd492d8-8e6e-4f42-9772-a31a9a81e0fc-Aviary_20Photo_130168321825574776.png","description":"Editor-in-Chief here at MP. 213 lbs. of snark in an 105 lb. body. @alishagrauso on Twitter.","movie_subscription_count":60,"followers_count":1334,"verified":"staff","user_subscription_count":15,"weekly_readers":29229,"contributions_count":1062,"profile_public":true,"cover_image":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/covers/383872-ed802e0e-47d0-498e-b0a6-6c5d154e7169-Aviary_20Photo_130187239554979906.png","facebook_id":"61901310"},"related_pages":[{"published_at":"2012-10-30T23:18:37+01:00","title":"Star Wars: Episode VII","banner_image":null,"banner_image_new":null,"movie_list_item_image":null,"large_image":null,"brightcove_id":null,"permalink":"star-wars-episode-vii","facebook_mirror_id":null,"subscriber_count":30300,"theatrical_release_date":"2015-99-99-Estimated","season_premiere_date":null,"id":711158,"facebook_id":null,"badge_image":null,"has_content":true,"discoveryline_enabled":null,"type":"movie","banner":{"large":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images/1351680333_star1.jpg","medium":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images/medium_1351680333_star1.jpg","iphone":{"retina":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images/w640_1351680333_star1.jpg","nonretina":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images/w320_1351680333_star1.jpg"},"narrow":{"x":233,"y":8},"wide":{"y":27},"square":{"extralarge":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images_square_big/1351680333_star1.jpg","large":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images_square/1360751850_medium_1351680333_star1.jpg","retina":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images_square/w192_1360751850_medium_1351680333_star1.jpg","nonretina":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/project_images_square/w96_1360751850_medium_1351680333_star1.jpg","x":151}},"channel":{"id":234273,"type":"movie-channel","published_at":null,"name":"Sci-Fi Movies","movie_count":167,"series_count":0,"thumbnail_image":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/channel_images/ch-alien.jpg","cover_image":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/covers/14-a7497b4b-0a4c-419f-a163-f65cdfbed807-Sc-Planets-.jpg","icon":"http://img.moviepilot.com/assets/tarantulaV2/channel_images/ch-alien.jpg","short_name":"","permalink":"sci-fi-movies","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/SciFi-Movie-Channel/272663052744040","facebook_mirror_id":"272663052744040","description":"The future begins right here: The best science fiction movies coming to cinemas near you,  sooner or much later.

Goyer (<em>The Dark Knight Trilogy\u003C/em>, <em>Man of Steel\u003C/em>) has officially pitched a big screen version of Neil Gaiman&#39;s <a href=\"http://moviepilot.com/movies/401054-the-sandman\" class=\"project\" data-follow=\"project:401054\">The Sandman\u003C/a> to Warner Bros. Apparently, the studio has been &quot;very receptive&quot; to the idea and has attached comic book and television writer Geoff Johns (<em>Smallville\u003C/em>, <em>The Green Lantern\u003C/em>) to the project.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>However, that&#39;s not the only name to be mentioned in relation to <em>The Sandman\u003C/em>. Badass Digest&#39;s sources are also claiming that none other than <a href=\"http://moviepilot.com/people/49306-joseph-gordon-levitt\">Joseph Gordon-Levitt\u003C/a> is also involved, although they&#39;re currently unsure as to his role. Could he be starring? Will he play Morpheus? Or could he be involved behind the scenes? Unfortunately, no one knows at the moment, but this movie rumor does seem a lot healthier than most.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, Gaiman has <a href=\"http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=49229\">previously stated\u003C/a> that he personally envisions either <a href=\"http://moviepilot.com/people/80824-benedict-cumberbatch\">Benedict Cumberbatch\u003C/a> or <a href=\"http://moviepilot.com/people/111777-tom-hiddleston\">Tom Hiddleston\u003C/a> in the role — and with both of these actors also blowing up at the moment, I can imagine WB would also be receptive to these choices.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>(Source: <a href=\"http://badassdigest.com/2013/11/20/joseph-gordon-levitt-could-be-morpheus-in-the-sandman-movie\">Badass Digest\u003C/a>)\u003C/p>\n\n<p>What do you think?
