					<p><a href="http://wildhunt.org/tag/pagan-community-notes">Pagan Community Notes</a> is a series focused on news originating from within the Pagan community. Reinforcing the idea that what happens to and within our organizations, groups, and events is news, and news-worthy. My hope is that more individuals, especially those working within Pagan organizations, get into the habit of sharing their news with the world. So let’s get started!</p>
<div id="attachment_9574" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://wildhunt.org/2012/12/top-ten-pagan-stories-of-2012-part-one.html/chnowa" ><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-9574" alt="The Maetreum of Cybele's building." src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/chnowa-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Maetreum of Cybele</p></div>
<p>The <a href="http://gallae.com/">Maetreum of Cybele</a>, which had <a href="http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/maetreum-of-cybele-win-tax-fight.html">just won an important legal victory in their property tax fight against the Town of Catskill in New York</a>, has been the victim of another vandalism attack. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Maetreum/posts/10151828554738367">The news was posted Sunday morning at the religious order&#8217;s official Facebook page</a>. Quote: <em>&#8220;The Maetreum was attacked again last night with four windows broken out, three in the cafe and on the second floor. The Circle W next door was also hit.. Cops taking it very seriously this time.&#8221;</em> The reason police are taking the matter seriously is because the Maetreum was <a href="http://wildhunt.org/2013/09/pagan-community-notes-patrick-mccollum-at-the-un-vikingdom-controversy-and-more.html">attacked by a rock-and-epithet-throwing individual back in September</a>. Quote: <em>“Last night while I was enjoying talking to Cathryn Platine at the Maetreum of Cybele, a teenager/young man started throwing rocks at the house. At first we thought it was just branches falling, but then the window in the kitchen broke from two rocks that were thrown through the window. It was just Cathy and I downstairs so I followed her outside. The young man ran from the bushes near the road across the road, and then began taunting us&#8230;&#8221;</em> Are these events unconnected? Simple hooliganism? Or has the high-profile nature of the Maetreum&#8217;s tax fight brought out the haters? We&#8217;ll keep you posted as this story develops.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ardantane.org/">Ardantane Pagan Learning Center</a>, located in north-central New Mexico, <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sacred-land-dedicated-to-hekate">has launched an IndieGoGo Fundraiser to help develop land purchased adjacent to their current property</a> into a space dedicated to the goddess Hekate, complete with stone circle. Quote: <em>&#8220;Do you honor Hekate, the Lady of the Crossroads, Keeper of the Keys, Queen of the Witches, Goddess of Heaven, Earth, and the Underworld? Then help us honor Her with land and a ritual circle, dedicated to Her in perpetuity. Ardantane Pagan Learning Center is located in north-central New Mexico, at the edge of the Jemez Mountains, about an hour’s drive from Albuquerque. We have purchased over two acres of wild land adjacent to our campus, named it Spirit Hollow, and dedicated it to Hekate, who is one of the patron deities of our school. Here we have created a stone circle for Her, and hope to add a shrine and processional way from the main campus. We also plan to hold a Hekate Retreat on the weekend nearest one of Her holy days. But we need your help.&#8221;</em> There are a number of Hekate-themed donation perks for those who give to this initiative. The fund drive runs through the next 30 days.</p>

<p>Over at Patheos, <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/johnbeckett/2013/11/the-moonlady-retires.html">John Beckett reports on the announced retirement of journalist Amy Martin</a>, who ran the Texas-centric service known at <a href="http://moonlady.com/">Moonlady News</a>. Quote: <em>&#8220;Moonlady was Moonlady News, a massive moderated e-mail list for Pagan, New Age, environmental and other progressive events and causes in the Dallas – Fort Worth area, run by <a href="http://moonlady.com/moonlady-media/meet-the-moonlady/">Amy Martin, the Moonlady</a>.  This week Amy announced her retirement – Moonlady News will make its last run on December 20.&#8221;</em> <a href="http://moonlady.com/moonlady-moves-on-amys-goodbye-letter/">In her farewell letter, Martin says that she wants to devote her life to personal writing.</a> Quote: <em>&#8220;With the completion of Moonlady News as we know it, Moonlady retires as well. I’ve been an activist since I was 12. Over 45 years, 20 of it with the Moonlady community, working every day for a better world. My passion, my core identity, is being a writer and I must devote myself to that. I’m not getting younger and there are a few major creative projects baying at the gate to be completed. That’s kind of scary, having no more excuses, but exciting. I am grateful for you all. Someday I’ll tell the full story, of how knowing you were out there, and being of service to you, kept me going through the worst time of my life.&#8221;</em> My hats off to her, and I wish Amy Martin well with her writing. The work she is doing is important, and I hope her example inspires others. <a href="http://moonlady.com/donate/">You can also donate to defray the operating costs of the site.</a></p>

<li>The recently debuted Australia-centered <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OtherMagazine">Other Magazine</a> is already giving sneak peeks at the next issue, including an article on Australia&#8217;s oldest Pagan festival gathering. Quote: <em style="line-height: normal;">“When Michel Marold first visited Mt Franklin in 1978 he was awed by the ancient natural feature, and soon tapped in to the liminal ‘otherness’ and primal power of the place, connecting to an invisible current that had lit up the caldera of the extinct volcano for thousands of years.”</em> <a href="http://other-magazine.com/subscribe/">You can subscribe here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.americanmysticthemovie.com/bios/">Alex Mar</a>, director of the recent documentary film <a href="http://www.americanmysticthemovie.com/">&#8220;American Mystic&#8221;</a> (featuring Morpheus Ravenna), is currently researching contemporary American Pagan ideas about funerary rites. She is now specifically seeking thoughts on funeral pyres and excarnation (a.k.a. sky burial) as traditional practices that have yet to be introduced in this country. If you have a personal interest in either of these rites, whether for yourself or a loved one, and would like to share your thoughts and opinions, please contact her. She is seeking Pagan perspectives from all regions of the country. You can reach Alex Mar at:<a href="mailto:funeraryrites@gmail.com" target="_blank">funeraryrites@gmail.com</a>.</li>

<blockquote><p><i>The Disney princess paradigm is defined by a system of American ideological and aesthetic codes that are known to the Disney artists and their viewers. The heroine is recognized when she stands on a balcony letting her long hair blow in the breeze, when she sings in the forest, or when she wishes for that which is beyond her grasp…</i><i>The attributes are visual, narrative, and musical.  Although the specifics have been updated, revised, and reformulated to conform to contemporary ideology, the essence of the Disney princess formula has remained intact.  As Walt put it, we always root for ‘</i><i>Cinderella and the Prince.’</i></p></blockquote>
<p>I wrote that in 1998 after completing an extensive two-year study on nine of Disney’s animated heroines. Now let’s flash forward 15 years to 2013. Disney has released the latest edition to its Princess Collection: <i>Frozen.</i>  How has the princess formula been &#8220;updated to conform to contemporary ideology&#8221;? How has it &#8220;remained intact&#8221;?  Why has this film been labeled “subversive?”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">Inspired by </span><a style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;" href="http://hca.gilead.org.il/" target="_blank">Hans Christian Anderson’s story <em>The Snow Queen</em></a><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">, Disney’s </span><i style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">Frozen</i><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"> tells the story of two princess sisters Elsa and Anna who live in the fictional Scandinavian land of Arrendelle.  Elsa is born with the gift of ice magic which strengthens over time.  After being crowned Queen, she accidentally freezes her kingdom and flees to a life of self-imposed isolation. The narrative continues as Anna journeys to save Arrendelle and, ultimately, thaw a long-frozen sororal relationship.</span></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TbQm5doF_Uc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>For fans of <a href="http://hca.gilead.org.il/" target="_blank">Anderson’s original tale</a>, this film bears little resemblance. When Disney says “loosely-based,” the operative word is “loose.”  For example, Anderson’s narrative is woven around a heavy Christian theological ethic. Gerda unfreezes Kay’s heart only by virtue of being a “Christ-child.”  As for the film, there are several subtle visual suggestions of a Christian landscape; most notably in the coronation scene. Otherwise Disney’s <i>Frozen</i> is absent of any <i>overt</i> religiosity.</p>
<p>I point to the film’s ethical construction because that is the point at which <i>Frozen</i> deviates from the traditional. In typical princess films, the moral universe is constructed through the juxtaposition of recognizable good and bad characters. With few exceptions, witches, bad step-mothers, sorcerers, and Vodou priests are evil.  The good “guys” are the princesses, would-be suitors and their cute little animal companions.</p>
<p><em>Frozen</em> subverts this tradition by presenting a new ethical dynamic – a complexity that has yet to occur within any past Disney princess. The “evil” exists within its heroine: Elsa.  She is born with magical powers which, as a child, she attempts to “conceal and not feel.”  As noted by the troll king, magic can be used for good or bad.  He demonstrates <i>good magic</i> as cued visually by blue, sky-like imagery.  He demonstrates <i>bad magic</i> with red, subtle hell-like imagery.  Here is a great example of covert religious iconography present in secular films.</p>
<p><a href="http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Frozen/Gallery?file=Elsa_crowned.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130710170360/disney/images/thumb/b/b9/Elsa_crowned.jpg/300px-Elsa_crowned.jpg" width="300" height="129" /></a></p>
<p>Just after Elsa is crowned queen, her magic power is unleashed and she flees from Arrendelle.  At this point, she ceases to be a princess-maiden and has become the queen-mother. The courtiers condemn her as a “sorceress and monster.”  She becomes the movie’s witch.  Interestingly, the writers offer a bit of symbolic foreshadowing when sister Anna walks by a painting and says, “Hi Joan,” referring to Joan of Arc the historical figure condemned of sorcery.</p>
<p>Here is where the narrative takes an ethical turn, subverting everything we know about Disney princess stories.  When Elsa arrives at the top of a mountain, she begins her show-stopping song: “Let it Go!” She embraces her magic and transforms her life. The process is signified by Elsa’s visual change from a buttoned-up, high-collared dress to a shimmering, trailing gown with plunging necklines.  As she walks out onto the balcony, hips swaying and hair flowing, Elsa demonstrates full control of her life, her magic and her sexuality.</p>
<p>No Disney female character has ever completely owned her magical existence within the narrative <i>and remained “good.”</i>  No Disney heroine has been this free – even <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1217209/" target="_blank">Pixar’s Merida (<i>Brave</i> 2012.) </a> To be fair, <em>Brave</em> did twist the princess paradigm.  Merida doesn’t find her true love before the credits role. It is important to note that both Pixar’s <i>Brave </i>and <i>Frozen</i> have the distinction of being the only two Disney-produced princess films with a female co-director.</p>
<p><a href="http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Frozen/Gallery?file=Elsa_the_snow_queen_2013.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130706130747/disney/images/thumb/0/0a/Elsa_the_snow_queen_2013.jpg/300px-Elsa_the_snow_queen_2013.jpg" width="300" height="132" /></a></p>
<p>Regardless of Brave’s twist, Merida doesn’t shun marriage. She just waits.  Elsa is completely different. She is a heroine who is both magical and highly-sexualized – two traits usually reserved for wicked women.  Fans of Broadway may almost hear Elsa singing:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Something has changed within me; Something is not the same.</i><i><br />
I&#8217;m through with playing by the rules of someone else&#8217;s game…<br />
It’s time to try defying gravity.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps that’s because Elsa is voiced by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0579953/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1" target="_blank">Idina Menzel</a>, the actress who originated <a href="http://media.wickedthemusical.com/media/?gclid=CKKTxZe2j7sCFUsV7Aod5VEABg" target="_blank"><i>Wicked</i>’s Elphaba on Broadway</a>.  More likely, <i>Frozen </i>and <i>Wicked</i> both negotiate female agency in the same way. Wicked tells the story of a socially-isolated woman who is labeled a “witch” and subsequently defies all convention to be herself.  <i>Frozen</i>, in part, tells the same story.  Both women are terrified of hurting those they love which they can’t seem to stop doing.  Both women isolate themselves in a distant castle.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Elphaba the stories don’t end the same.  Elsa is allowed to remain a heroine, queen and witch.  Although there are points where the “red light” does appear in her magic, she manages to remain good.  We all know what happens to the Wicked Witch – despite Broadway’s silly rewrite.</p>
<p>With all of that said, <i>Frozen</i> doesn’t completely toss out the princess formula.  Sister Anna lives in the more traditional story complete with ball-gown, a romantic kiss and endearing secondary characters.  In fact, Anna is almost a repeat model of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398286/" target="_blank"><i>Tangled</i>’s Rapunzel</a>, both visually and narratively. In fact her male counterpart Kristoff and his reindeer, Sven, are repeats of Rapunzel’s Flynn Rider and his horse, Maximus.</p>
<p><a href="http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Frozen/Gallery?file=Anna_and_Kristoff_Disney.png"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://static4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130705191137/disney/images/thumb/6/62/Anna_and_Kristoff_Disney.png/300px-Anna_and_Kristoff_Disney.png" width="300" height="134" /></a></p>
<p>However, Princess Anna does play a major role in the biggest subversion of the princess paradigm within the film. <strong>(<i>Spoiler Alert</i>)</strong> When Elsa inadvertently freezes Anna’s heart, the trolls reveal that only an act of true love can save her from the “witch’s” magic. We, and the characters, assume this to mean true love’s kiss. <em> How many of these movies have we seen?</em></p>
<p>Think again. True love turns out to be the love between the two women. In the end, Anna sacrifices herself to save her sister’s life. That becomes the act of true love. No romantic kiss. No man. Just the two sisters.</p>
<p>While one of <em>Frozen</em>’s Princess story lines is subversive, the other is not.  The crossing of the two challenges our expectations and ends with sisters rekindling their lost love without sacrificing who either of them has become &#8211; Witch Queen or Princess.</p>

<p>With <i>Frozen</i>, Disney hasn’t reinvented its formula, it just poked some serious holes in it.  There are choices now. Going back to my original argument:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Although the specifics have been updated, revised, and reformulated to conform to contemporary ideology, the essence of the Disney princess formula has remained intact.  As Walt put it, we always root for ‘</i><i>Cinderella and the Prince.’</i></p></blockquote>
<p>That still stands. We can root for Anna and Kristoff.  However we can also root for the Snow Queen and her beautiful magic &#8211; the ice, snow and the melting that comes from her love.</p><div class='kindleWidget kindleLight' ><img src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/plugins/send-to-kindle/media/white-15.png" /><span>Send to Kindle</span></div><p><span class='st_facebook_buttons' st_title='Disney&#8217;s Frozen: A tale of two princesses' st_url='http://wildhunt.org/2013/12/disneys-frozen-a-tale-of-two-princesses.html' displayText='Facebook'></span><span class='st_twitter_buttons' st_title='Disney&#8217;s Frozen: A tale of two princesses' st_url='http://wildhunt.org/2013/12/disneys-frozen-a-tale-of-two-princesses.html' displayText='Twitter'></span><span class='st_email_buttons' st_title='Disney&#8217;s Frozen: A tale of two princesses' st_url='http://wildhunt.org/2013/12/disneys-frozen-a-tale-of-two-princesses.html' displayText='Email'></span><span class='st_sharethis_buttons' st_title='Disney&#8217;s Frozen: A tale of two princesses' st_url='http://wildhunt.org/2013/12/disneys-frozen-a-tale-of-two-princesses.html' displayText='ShareThis'></span><span class='st_fblike_buttons' st_title='Disney&#8217;s Frozen: A tale of two princesses' st_url='http://wildhunt.org/2013/12/disneys-frozen-a-tale-of-two-princesses.html' displayText='Facebook Like'></span><span class='st_plusone_buttons' st_title='Disney&#8217;s Frozen: A tale of two princesses' st_url='http://wildhunt.org/2013/12/disneys-frozen-a-tale-of-two-princesses.html' displayText='Google +1'></span><span class='st_pinterest _buttons' st_title='Disney&#8217;s Frozen: A tale of two princesses' st_url='http://wildhunt.org/2013/12/disneys-frozen-a-tale-of-two-princesses.html' displayText='Pinterest'></span></p>					</div><!-- /.entry-content -->

					<p>It&#8217;s rare that I use the forum of The Wild Hunt to engage in columnist-style musings, but I felt called to do it in the wake of recent events, posts, and comments that have swirled around this site. I&#8217;m used to flare-ups of controversy, issues that are divisive among different populations within our larger movement sparking heated comment, it comes as part of running a journalistic outlet. Through it all, I have tried to stay true to my inner convictions, because, frankly, the editorial buck has to stop somewhere. As a result I&#8217;ve grown a pretty thick skin, and learned to largely stay out of Internet debates, even when folks started becoming downright conspiratorial about my motivations. So today, I thought I&#8217;d speak on my motivations, and why I do The Wild Hunt, why I&#8217;m a Pagan, and why I care about a larger religious movement that some call &#8220;modern Paganism.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_10081" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wildhunt.org/2013/01/scientology-and-the-paths-wicca-didnt-take.html/lammas_fire" ><img class="size-full wp-image-10081" alt="Selena Fox of Circle Sanctuary leading a Lammas bonfire ritual." src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/lammas_fire-e1343779840234.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Selena Fox of Circle Sanctuary leading a Lammas bonfire ritual.</p></div>
<p>I became a Pagan, or more precisely, a self-dedicated Wiccan at the age of 17. I sat in a damp copse of trees, lit a candle, and used a dedication ritual written by Scott Cunningham. It was hardly a dramatic or theatrical affair, but I do confess to feeling different afterwards, as if I had finally made a choice in a choose-your-own-adventure novel, and took my thumb out that was holding my place in case I did the wrong thing (admit it, you all did that with those books). I went right to the local gift shop in the mall, bought a large-ish pewter pentacle, and I never looked back. Over the intervening years I&#8217;ve worked with a variety of groups, some formal, some not, had a couple initiations, and weathered some dark corners within our community that few like to talk about. I never lost sight of what Paganism offered me, what the promise of these emerging religions were.</p>
<p>For me, the offer of Paganism was no less than an entirely different lens through which to see the world. To literally re-enchant the world, to see a place that was full of gods, powers, myth, and yes, magic. To offer a paradigm that was very much at odds with the midwestern baseline protestantism that was a part of everything growing up in Nebraska in the 1980s. Even in my younger (and rather naive) days, I sensed the revolutionary potential of Paganism, that it if allowed to grow would literally change the way we think. Now, I had no grudge against Christianity, I do not have a horror story of my younger days of mistreatment, persecution, or alienation, so this wasn&#8217;t a personal matter, I simply found Pagan religions more alluring to my sensibilities. A childhood entranced by fantasy, mythology, and art. Here, I thought, was a place where difference, and different ideas, would be embraced.</p>
<p>I think I should also make clear that I saw Paganism through a lens of an aspiring artist. For the bulk of my younger life, my main aspiration was to create a life in which I could paint and draw in some professional capacity. I was entranced by romantic ideas of large studios, and block-white gallery cubes hosting swanky parties while featuring my work. I thrilled during my 20s to the melodrama of the Abstract Expressionists of the 50s, or the Neo-Expressionists of the 80s, thinking that someday I too would find a creative tribe to break through with. The gods, of course, often have other plans. Instead of the swanky galleries, I did a run of smaller local shows, tried to organize some smaller initiatives, and slowly drifted into a variety of graphic design jobs in my late 20s. So for me, Paganism was as much an aesthetic choice as it was a religious choice. Despite the great Christian-themed art of the past, I felt in my heart that Paganism offered me the spiritual freedom to really work. To imbue what I was doing with the numinous.</p>
<div id="attachment_10750" style="width: 343px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://wildhunt.org/2012/12/modern-pagan-religions-now-over-80k-in-england-and-wales.html/42208146_druids_afp416" ><img class=" wp-image-10750 " alt="Pagans at Stonehenge." src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/42208146_druids_afp416.jpg" width="333" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pagans at Stonehenge.</p></div>
<p>Given this, I thought what I had to offer Paganism in return for what Paganism had offered me was my creative work. That my art would help shape a fine-art aesthetic within my religious community, one that was still very much enchanted by fantasy-style illustration (not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that, mind you). That, however, was not what Paganism, the gods, the powers that be, wanted me to offer them it seemed. They wanted me to write, to do this. Something I would have never anticipated, especially since I never considered myself a gifted writer. Certainly not someone who could serve as a journalistic mouthpiece for a movement. Yet, something I started on a lark, as an experiment that I hoped would garner the attention of the &#8220;professionals&#8221; out there in the nebulous distance, became a phenomenon a couple short years into its existence.  Suddenly &#8220;The Wild Hunt&#8221; was not a repository for my art and varied musings on culture, a host to a variety of mini-sites that I had created out of boredom or new enthusiasms in the wild, wild, West days of the Internet, no, The Wild Hunt was now the adolescent version of what you read here.</p>
<p>March, 2014, will mark ten years of doing this, nearly every day. In that time I believe I&#8217;ve become a somewhat better writer. I&#8217;ve been honored to meet, talk to, and interview a variety of people I had once only read about. Better still, I was able to approach them as peers. In many ways this project has grown to a level I could never have conceived of when I started it. That I would be able to raise a budget, pay contributors, and grow to size that is impressive for an independent site like this is remarkable to me. Naturally, when you grow in size you also become a bigger target. Few people cared what I said or thought back in 2005, but in 2013 what I publish here is given a weight that can be daunting at times. I would be lying if I said that the strain of expectation wasn&#8217;t sometimes more than I feel I can bear, and for the last several years I have wrestled with intermittent bouts of burn-out. No matter how excellent you strive to be, there will always be someone who is unhappy with the way things are done. The main accusation made against my person is that I&#8217;m some sort of sell-out, that I&#8217;m secretly batting for some faction, religion, or viewpoint. The truth is far more mundane, and far less exciting.</p>
<p><a href="http://wildhunt.org/about/jason-pitzl-waters/jason" ><img class="alignleft  wp-image-10460" alt="jason" src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/jason.jpg" width="168" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>The simple truth is that I&#8217;m a simple Pagan. I still think of Paganism as a lens that I choose to see the world through, I still do my best to honor that point of view, while allowing the people who write for me to be true to their lens. No one is more consistently aware of my imperfections than me, and certainly no criticism I&#8217;ve received has completely surprised me. Part of that is because no matter how total my Pagan worldview, real life is messy, and imperfect, and sometimes doesn&#8217;t hew to a rational or logical party/theological line. However imperfectly, I have tried to report on modern Paganism with the messiness intact, because I think what those cracks say reveals important things about our own process. I fight the urge to defend myself, for the most part, because I hope that my legacy as a whole will speak for itself in the longer run. That the number of articles about our triumphs, our advances, our struggles, will always outnumber the articles that stop for a moment and question the messiness of our life on the ground. Naturally I will endeavor to always improve, and I hope to make some announcements soon that will make The Wild Hunt even better.</p>
<p>What will the next ten years hold? I cannot say. But this is part of what Paganism has offered me, and what I offered Paganism in return.

					<p>I was just about to get on my bike when I looked in the basket and saw the note.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“When you’re done finding Jesus, come by the shop and say hi.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It made me laugh, and yet it also immediately brought me back to something I had been thinking about a lot lately. Indeed, my bike, which is well-known downtown and easily recognizable, had been locked up outside First Christian Church for the past two hours while I was inside for a meeting with a small group that included the church’s pastor. The author of the note was a Pagan friend of mine who worked around the corner from the church, and I sensed that the mood behind the note was both joking and curious at the same time. And while I hadn’t found Jesus in the previous two hours, I realized in that moment that I had been finding Jesus popping up constantly in my work over the past few years. It also occurred to me that at this point I had completely normalized these constant interactions with churches, pastors, and those who follow the philosophy of Jesus in a way that many Pagans would find a little strange to say the least.</p>
<div id="attachment_12276" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/reflections-on-service-theology-oppression-and-love.html/first_christian_church_eugene-2" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-12276" alt="First Christian Church in Eugene, Oregon." src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/First_Christian_Church_Eugene-2-500x333.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">First Christian Church in Eugene, Oregon.</p></div>
<p>I find it a more than a little strange myself at times. But the process of building those bridges has led me to not only greatly respect and appreciate those who work with the poor in the name of Jesus, but has brought me to constantly recognize and reflect on the fact that other than the specifics behind the deity that called us all to the table, we are all in the exact same fight for pretty much the exact same reasons. Over time I have unexpectedly come to understand and accept that the church folks are without a doubt my greatest allies, politically as well as spiritually.</p>
<p>I work with the poor and the homeless. I found myself doing so as a result of listening to both my conscience as well as the Gods. I do this work because I was called to it through an unexpected merging of ethics and spirit. It is much more a divine mandate than a free choice; for me it is a calling in the true religious sense, and yet not one that results from any specific belief or doctrine. Most people who work with the poor in the same way that I do fall into three categories: those who work for government agencies, those who work for non-profit organizations or social service agencies, and those who are following the teachings of Jesus. More often than not I find myself to be the only person in the room who stands apart from these three groups.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="youtube"><iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rs991O-cee4?wmode=transparent&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showsearch=0&amp;rel=1&amp;theme=dark" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></span></p>
<p>When I first felt the pull that started me on this journey, I recognized that the spiritual narrative around that pull was much common and relevant to Christianity than it was to Paganism. While I hadn’t quite given up all my worldly possessions and sworn a vow of poverty, I have sacrificed a theoretical life of ‘comfort’ and inevitably accepted a life of near-poverty in order to do this work full-time in a way that at least in America, is seldom seen outside of a Christian context. Jesus tended to the poor, preached to his followers that they should do the same, and an untold number of people since then have dedicated their lives to the poor in the name of Jesus. I had never stumbled upon a Pagan parallel to this phenomenon, at least not in terms of service to the poor. For me, while this work is a spiritual calling, it is not necessarily an extension of my religious beliefs. There is nothing specific in the teachings of my tradition that critiques wealth or that tells me to serve the poor, nor have I ever stumbled upon related teachings or mythologies that command service to the poor and a rejection of wealth with anywhere near the strength and passion that the teachings of Jesus do.</p>
<p>Most Pagan-identified folks that I know personally who have devoted their lives to a cause tend to dedicate themselves to environmental or civil rights-related issues. They do so with the same degree of ethical motivation and spiritual dedication that I see among the Christians who work with the poor, but they do so in the name of the Earth and/or their Gods as opposed to Jesus Christ. My own activist path brought me to the forest years ago, and it was a natural and direct extension of my spiritual path at the time to be protecting the forest from loggers. It was a passion and drive that directly put my religious beliefs into practice, the belief that the Earth was sacred and needed to be protected. It was a passion, but not a calling. The Gods never insisted that I stay in the forest. They do, however, keep insisting that I work with the poor, and by extension of that insistence I find myself constantly working closely with others who are not only acting in accordance with the insistence of a different God, but who also have a solid text of quotes and reference points as to why they are commanded to serve the poor. I don’t have a comparable reference text. In many ways, my only true reference texts are contained in the reflections and thoughts of others and the constant signs and signals from the universe itself.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>But in pondering the perceived lack of mythology/theology that could serve as guidance on this journey as someone who is operating on the basis of divine imperative, I’ve also come face-to-face with the other side of the coin: how this lack of relevant mythology can affect those who are on the receiving end of divine mercy.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In my experience, <strong>there are a much higher percentage of self-identifying Pagans in the homeless community than there are in the general population</strong>. While I would still say that a majority of the homeless population identifies as Christian, the amount of people on the street who subscribe to some sort of Pagan belief system is quite striking and somewhat surprising at first. It made perfect sense to me quite quickly, as it was easy to see how living on the physical and psychic margins of society would bring with it the tendency of adopting an earth-centered, polytheistic, and/or magical philosophy. But what is even more notable, and in time has become more and more relevant to me, is the way that the beliefs and practices of the two groups often blend together in the context of street life and the way that the two groups have found mutual agreement in ways that are quite atypical but accurately reflective of their situation. I equally seem to run across self-identified Pagans who embrace Jesus in the same manner that their Christian counterparts do, as well as many who considered themselves to be Christian and yet are accepting and often even participatory in the beliefs and practices of their Pagan friends and neighbors.</p>
<p>My friend Mary Ann, <a href="http://wildhunt.org/2013/08/patterns-histories-and-tendencies-of-place.html">who lives in a symbiotic relationship with the riverbank</a>, is one of the Pagans I know who has a deep love for and faith in Jesus. Early on in our friendship, I once asked her why.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Well, there ain’t no pagan Jesus. at least not when it comes to looking after the poor,” </em>she said.<em> “I’m not saying that you can’t compare Jesus to some of the old gods in many ways, but I never heard of Osiris and Dionysis tending to the poor and oppressed, chastising the rich, specifically promising the persecuted an eternity in Heaven. Jesus has got my back. Who else has got my back like that? None of the other gods or spirits I talk to. They got my back for other reasons, but not because I’m poor. They don’t want to liberate me. They don’t inspire masses of others to fight oppression. Not like Jesus does.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>She had an important point, a point which related closely to my own musings around the spiritual nature of my work and what I was increasingly viewing as a theological hole of sorts in Pagan mythology around poverty and the poor. What Mary Ann spoke of not only pointed to that hole, but also reminded me in the instant of how Jesus is framed in both liberation theology and black theology. Mary Ann sought a deity of liberation, and found that energy to be strongest in her understanding of Jesus.</p>
<div id="attachment_11837" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wildhunt.org/2013/08/patterns-histories-and-tendencies-of-place.html/photo-5" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-11837" alt="North bank of the Willamette river." src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo-500x373.jpg" width="500" height="373" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">North bank of the Willamette river.</p></div>
<p>Not long after that encounter, I was on the opposite bank of the river when I came across another homeless friend, one I knew to be a regular at the local Methodist church. He was perched at the river, with flowers and what looked like salt his hand, and from where I stood ten feet back or so it appeared as though he was making offerings to the river. He turned around, saw me, and waved me over.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“What kind of pagan nonsense are you up to?”</em> I teased.</p>
<div id="attachment_12275" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/reflections-on-service-theology-oppression-and-love.html/conestoga-hut" ><img class=" wp-image-12275 " alt="Conestoga Hut" src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Conestoga-Hut-375x500.jpg" width="300" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Conestoga Hut</p></div>
<p><em>“You’re not the first to ask,”</em> he said. <em>“I’ll just say this: you live our here long enough, and this place becomes alive in a way where you would have to be a fool to ignore it. The least I can do is acknowledge it.”</em> That’s the other side of the reflection, I thought to myself. The missing theology from his own religion, which he supplemented with what he learned from the activities and beliefs of his Pagan peers. I saw this as the inverse of what both Mary Ann and I found to be missing in Pagan spirituality. His words reminded me immediately of conversations I’ve had with friends who identify as “Christo-Pagans”, who have told me that they walk that path mainly because the reverence of nature and nature spirits is for the most part absent from the theology and liturgy of Christianity.</p>
<p>It makes sense that ideological sticking points become rather irrelevant in the face of oppression, desperation, and survival. While Pagans living in housed communities often face the realities of Christian oppression on a regular basis, on the street everyone is equally subject to specific oppressive forces from outside the street community which act with no regard to creed. Those forces cause the community to unite and put differences aside just as much out of necessity as choice, but they put aside and embrace their differences in an honest and authentic manner. While a few homeless Pagans I know have very strong negative reactions to anything related to churches or Christianity, many do not view Christianity as an oppressive and harmful force in the way that seems to be the status quo among most housed Pagans. If anything, the churches are often the only institutions that help and protect them in the face of systematic oppression from both government and citizenry alike. Churches feed them, help to shelter them, provide clothing, toiletries, and other resources, and in Eugene most of them do so with no strings attached, no conversion attempts, and with a sincere respect for the fact that many of those they are serving may not be of the same faith. One of the churches in town housed a Pagan woman in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNwnKJ0vDcc">Conestoga hut</a> for several months this past year. Not only did the pastor welcome the idea of a Solstice ritual in the parking lot, but he <a href="http://www.mychurchevents.com/calendar/calendar.aspx?list_by=calendar_month&amp;begin_date=6/1/2013%2012:00:00%20AM&amp;ci=G1I3I3I3J4J4O9L6I3&amp;igd=">advertised the event on his congregational calendar</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="youtube"><iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BNwnKJ0vDcc?wmode=transparent&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showsearch=0&amp;rel=1&amp;theme=dark" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></span></p>
<p>I’ve basically been a polytheist since I was first old enough to understand the concept. I have never had either a significant interest in nor a significant resentment towards Christianity, save for an overall wariness and skepticism that I hold towards all institutional powers. Before I ever worked with the poor, I always regarded Jesus as one of a untold number of deities out there, one whose fan club seems to have missed the point of his teachings for the most part. But this work has brought me in contact with so many individuals and communities of faith that have not missed the point, and my experiences in their company have brought me a deep understanding of the energy of love that is Jesus and how it affects both those who serve the poor in his name and those who are oppressed and seek out his comfort. Working in such environments motivated by love and compassion also makes me strongly yearn for such a tradition of service to the poor in my own community. I realize that my experience in itself is most likely atypical and to an extent is a reflection of a community that is known for progressive ethics and religious diversity just as much as it is a testament to the power of those who truly follow the teachings of Jesus. But their example and their kinship helps me to fill the holes I found in my own theology, not so much filled through teachings of Jesus himself but from what I see and learn from those who reflect and emulate that energy in their words and actions and the love shown towards the poor.</p>
<p>While I have no desire to explore religious Christianity beyond the interactions that are already built into my present life, Teo Bishop’s recent piece about <a href="http://www.bishopinthegrove.com/go-ahead-and-belove/">why he felt called back to Christianity</a> spoke to me on a very deep level, and was a strong reminder of the sacred aspect of being in service to the poor. The moment that Teo describes in his interaction with a homeless woman, and the way that he was affected by that interaction is the kind of moment that I sometimes experience on a daily basis. And in the desperation and helplessness that I too often feel in those moments, often it is a specific taste, a specific energy that comes through. There is a current of surrender and desperation in those moments where you truly do give your heart, and the essence in that moment is incomparable to anything other than what I have come to understand as the love and energy that is Jesus.</p>
<p>A few days after I read Teo’s piece, I was riding my bike along an underpass when I saw two police officers in the process of rousting and citing a group of homeless campers. I remembered that the owner of the shopping complex next door had been regularly complaining to police about the homeless that take refuge under the bridge. As I stopped and approached to watch, someone came up behind me. I heard a man muttering softly as the police began to write another ticket.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And there it was, that energy again, that sentiment that has no other comparison. I tried to think of something else to say, but nothing came. In that moment, I was grateful for those words. They were words of hope in an otherwise hopeless moment, originally spoken by someone who I knew for certain had our backs in this.</p><div class='kindleWidget kindleLight' ><img src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/plugins/send-to-kindle/media/white-15.png" /><span>Send to Kindle</span></div><p><span class='st_facebook_buttons' st_title='Reflections on Service, Theology, Oppression, and Love' st_url='http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/reflections-on-service-theology-oppression-and-love.html' displayText='Facebook'></span><span class='st_twitter_buttons' st_title='Reflections on Service, Theology, Oppression, and Love' st_url='http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/reflections-on-service-theology-oppression-and-love.html' displayText='Twitter'></span><span class='st_email_buttons' st_title='Reflections on Service, Theology, Oppression, and Love' st_url='http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/reflections-on-service-theology-oppression-and-love.html' displayText='Email'></span><span class='st_sharethis_buttons' st_title='Reflections on Service, Theology, Oppression, and Love' st_url='http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/reflections-on-service-theology-oppression-and-love.html' displayText='ShareThis'></span><span class='st_fblike_buttons' st_title='Reflections on Service, Theology, Oppression, and Love' st_url='http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/reflections-on-service-theology-oppression-and-love.html' displayText='Facebook Like'></span><span class='st_plusone_buttons' st_title='Reflections on Service, Theology, Oppression, and Love' st_url='http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/reflections-on-service-theology-oppression-and-love.html' displayText='Google +1'></span><span class='st_pinterest _buttons' st_title='Reflections on Service, Theology, Oppression, and Love' st_url='http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/reflections-on-service-theology-oppression-and-love.html' displayText='Pinterest'></span></p>					</div><!-- /.entry-content -->

					<p><a href="http://wildhunt.org/tag/pagan-community-notes">Pagan Community Notes</a> is a series focused on news originating from within the Pagan community. Reinforcing the idea that what happens to and within our organizations, groups, and events is news, and news-worthy. My hope is that more individuals, especially those working within Pagan organizations, get into the habit of sharing their news with the world. So let’s get started!</p>

The largest indoor Pagan conference in the United States <a href="https://pantheacon.com/wordpress/at-pantheacon/whats-happening/program-guide/">has just released its 2014 programming schedule</a>, featuring a dizzying array of talks, panels, and workshops.

Thorn Coyle, a panel discussion on sacrifice hosted by Coru Cathubodua, Lupercalia with Ekklesia Antinoou, and much, much, much, more!

Met with the lawyer yesterday, to form a Non Profit and apply for 501c3 by the end of the year this will have been accomplished. I like to thank those who donated money to the cause, we raised enough for the 501c3, and generous donations from WOM and MWB paid for creation of the Non-profit. Starting on 1/1/14 we will accepting applications for pagan high school seniors for $500 scholarship.&#8221;</em> The new scholarship will be called the Michigan Pagan Scholarship, and the nascent organization <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/MichiganPaganScholarship/">has started a group on Facebook</a>. The Tempest Smith Foundation has been <em>&#8220;a voice for diversity tolerance in its Michigan community and an advocate of anti-bullying campaigns,&#8221;</em> and it looks like Michigan Pagans are going to make sure its legacy lives on.  We will report more on this story as it develops.</p>

<li>Esoteric artist <a href="http://www.adelaleibowitz.com/">Adela Leibowitz</a> has <a href="http://hpgrpgalleryny.com/current-exhibits/main-space/">opened a new show this month at hpgrp Gallery in New York</a>, with pieces focusing on Mesopotamian and Egyptian Mythology. Quote: <em style="line-height: normal;">&#8220;Unlike earlier series such as Fairytales of the Macabre (2004) and The Cassandra Prophesies, (2006), which focused on Western tales, Leibowitz turns to Eastern religions and mythologies in “Mesopotamian and Egyptian Mythology.” In this exhibition, she continues her explorations by re-animating gods and goddesses, chaos demons, sages, protective deities and mythical hybrids. She places them in lush, tropical landscapes that represent a primal world where humans, animals and nature co-exist together in harmony. In essence, she creates utopias.&#8221;</em> Also, <a href="http://www.phantasmaphile.com/2013/11/adela-leibowitz-show.html">check out the <em>Phantasmaphile</em> write-up</a>. The show runs through December 21st.</li>
<li>Just a reminder that <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/new-alexandrian-library-construction-fund/x/497880">the New Alexandrian Library&#8217;s short crowd-funding initiative</a> to continue the ongoing construction on their future physical space in Delaware has less than a week to go. So if libraries run by Pagan and esoteric interests is something you value, <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/new-alexandrian-library-construction-fund/x/497880">be sure to visit their IndieGoGo page and add your support</a>. For all of my coverage of the New Alexandrian Library, <a href="http://wildhunt.org/tag/new-alexandrian-library-project">click here</a>.</li>
<li>In other crowd-funding news, <a href="http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/pagan-voices-starhawk-sharon-knight-ivo-dominguez-jr-and-more.html">as I mentioned on Monday</a>, Starhawk has <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/support-diversity-scholarships-for-earth-activist-training/x/497880">launched an IndieGoGo campaign to fund diversity scholarships for Earth Activist Trainings</a>. Quote: <em style="line-height: normal;">&#8220;A small investment in Earth Activist Training has a huge ripple effect. Any amount you can donate will help diversify the environmental justice movement, bring new perspectives and insights into the permaculture movement, and give activists and community leaders the tools they need to build that beautiful world of the future we know is possible!&#8221;</em></li>
<li>Treadwell&#8217;s in London is <a href="http://www.treadwells-london.com/event/spare-one-man-play-november-30/">hosting a one-person play about artist and occultist Austin Osman Spare on November 30th</a>. Quote: <em style="line-height: normal;">&#8220;Set in the artist’s studio at the Elephant and Castle on the night  of a Blitz bombing, it shows Spare growing old in poverty, yet fiercely committed to his vision. In the course of the night, a rogue sigil unleashes unpredictable consequences. This ‘play conceived as an act of magic’, performed by the author, is both an homage to AOS and a playful exploration of Constable’s own esoteric work to ‘set us free from ourselves.’ <a href="http://www.southwarkmysteries.co.uk/john-constable/4535403213">John Constable </a>is a poet, playwright and magical practitioner best-known for The Southwark Mysteries, and for his acclaimed stage adaptation of Gormenghast.&#8221;</em></li>
<li>I&#8217;m always a big fan of crowd-funded tarot and oracle decks, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/delphi/tarot-of-delphi-know-thyself">and the Kickstarter for the Tarot of Delphi looks rather nice</a>. Quote: <em style="line-height: normal;">&#8220;Curated with fine art from the late 1830s to the early 1910s, the Tarot of Delphi is like a mini-museum. You can wander through this captivating deck – exploring the imagery, absorbing the colors and light, envisioning the lives depicted – and imagine yourself within its mythic narrative.&#8221;</em></li>

					<p>There are lots of articles and essays of interest to modern Pagans out there, sometimes more than I can write about in-depth in any given week. So The Wild Hunt must <a href="http://wildhunt.org/tag/unleash-the-hounds">unleash the hounds</a> in order to round them all up.</p>
<p><a href="http://wildhunt.org/?attachment_id=12266" ><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12266" alt="maetreum sign large" src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/maetreum-sign-large.jpg" width="480" height="319" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/maetreum-of-cybele-win-tax-fight.html">As I reported this past weekend</a>, the <a href="http://gallae.com/">Maetreum of Cybele</a> has finally won their property tax fight against the Town of Catskill in New York. So far, the only mainstream media (non-Pagan) outlet to report on this <a href="http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/PubArticleNY.jsp?id=1202629390678&amp;Pagan_Group_Wins_Tax_Exemption_for_Catskill_Property">has been The New York Law Journal</a> (registration needed to read the article), who note that town officials are <em style="line-height: normal;">&#8220;disappointed&#8221;</em> with the ruling, and are weighing whether to appeal the ruling to a higher court. &#8220;<em style="line-height: normal;">[Attorney Daniel] Vincelette said town officials believe the primary use of the property is as a &#8216;residential cooperative,&#8217; not for religious purposes. He denied that the nature of the group&#8217;s pagan beliefs has been a factor in the town&#8217;s opposition to the property tax exemption. &#8216;It was never ever a consideration or an issue at all,&#8217; he said.&#8221;</em> That statement seems rather laughable, considering the lengths the town has gone to fighting their exemption.</li>
<li>So, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/us/an-ex-mouseketeers-journey-back-to-christianity-from-paganism.html?_r=1&amp;">anybody read the New York Times lately</a>? In an article about Teo Bishop re-embracing Jesus, reporter Mark Oppenheimer interviews T. Thorn Coyle, Amy Hale, and myself, about the story (and the meta-story, I suppose). I thought that, all told, it was a fair and balanced snapshot of the situation, and I&#8217;m pleased that we weren&#8217;t subjected to a Christian counter-point for the sake of &#8220;balance.&#8221; This being a New York Times piece, it has gotten a lot of commentary and links, <a href="http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-30948-portland_pagan_blogger_embraces_christianity.html">including from a local Portland paper</a>, and <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/getreligion/2013/11/nytimes-mouseketeer-turned-pagan-turned-christian-tale/">our &#8220;friends&#8221; at Get Religion</a>. For those dismayed at the amount of attention this is getting, I encourage you to help build our community&#8217;s journalistic apparatus so we can have a bigger influence on mainstream journalism. Journalism isn&#8217;t something that just happens to us, it is something we can do.</li>
<li><em style="line-height: normal;"><a href="http://religionclause.blogspot.com/2013/11/shinto-is-growing-force-in-japanese.html">Religion Clause</a></em> points to <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/11/23/national/back-to-the-future-shintos-growing-influence-in-politics/#.UpFT8cSshcY">a Japan Times article on the growing influence of Shinto in Japanese politics</a>. Quote: <em style="line-height: normal;">&#8220;&#8216;They’re trying to restore what was removed by the U.S. Occupation reforms,&#8217; explains Mark Mullins, director of the Japan Studies Center at the University of Auckland. If it succeeds, the project amounts to the overturning of much of the existing order in Japan — a return to the past, with one eye on the future. [...] Many of the nation’s top elected officials, including Abe and Shimomura are members of the organization’s political wing, Shinto Seiji Renmei (officially, the Shinto Association of Spiritual Leadership — eschewing the word &#8216;political&#8217; from the title) [...] Seiji Renmei sees its mission as renewing the national emphasis on &#8216;Japanese spiritual values.&#8217; [...] Since its birth in 1969, Shinto Seiji Renmei has notched several victories in its quest to restore much of the nation’s prewar political and social architecture.&#8221;</em> This is a story I&#8217;ll be paying close attention to in the future, and one that Pagans who are interested in Shinto should also note.</li>
<li><a href="http://usreligion.blogspot.com/2013/11/vodou-in-early-republic-more-questions.html"><em>Religion in American History</em> looks at Vodou in the early American republic</a>, and finds more questions than answers. Quote: <em style="line-height: normal;">&#8220;Finding the place of Vodou in the early republic presents problems of definition and problems of sources and evidence relating to the practice of Vodou and the experiences of Dominguan migrants. In considering these issues, I stand by my interpretation of the evidence for Philadelphia, and now agree that Vodou may have been practiced in Dominguan communities elsewhere in the United States; however, there is much that remains unclear.&#8221; </em></li>
<li> Last week <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/11/21/2978091/cop19-ngo-walkout/">major environmental advocacy groups walked out of the climate talks in Poland</a>, stating that there&#8217;s been a lack of progress on achieving a sustainable future. Quote: <em style="line-height: normal;">&#8220;This is the <a href="http://grist.org/article/climate-walkout-big-green-groups-bail-on-cop-19/">first time</a> environmental groups have walked out of a UNFCCC conference.

<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/arts/television/sylvia-browne-dies-at-77-self-proclaimed-psychic.html">Famous psychic and author Sylvia Browne died last week at the age of 77</a>. A <a href="http://www.novus.org/home/index.cfm">Gnostic Christian</a>, Browne emerged as a popular figure in the 1990s and oversaw a vast media empire that included talk-show appearances, bestselling books, and luxury cruise ship experiences for fans. During her life, <a href="http://wildhunt.org/2013/05/sylvia-browne-amanda-berry-and-psychic-arts.html">Browne came under fire from many who saw her off-the-cuff style as irresponsible</a>, especially when it concerned life-or-death matters. Quote: <em style="line-height: normal;">&#8220;Although Ms. Browne often appeared on shows like &#8216;Larry King Live&#8217; and was a regular guest on &#8216;The Montel Williams Show,&#8217; much of her income came from customers who paid $700 to ask her questions over the telephone for 30 minutes. She was frequently taken to task by skeptics, most notably the professional psychic debunker James Randi. But the questions raised about her abilities did not damage her appeal as an author. She published more than 40 books, and many were mainstays on The New York Times’s best-seller list.&#8221;</em> No doubt Browne&#8217;s legacy will continue to be debated, and depending on your beliefs, perhaps she&#8217;ll still want a say on what that legacy was.</li>
<li>An Egyptian statue that had been rotating, seemingly of its own accord, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25034950">has been explained</a>. Quote: <em style="line-height: normal;">&#8220;An engineer, called in to look at the statue, found that that vibrations from a busy nearby road were causing the 3,800-year-old stone figure to rotate. The convex base of the figure made it &#8216;more susceptible&#8217; to spin around than the cabinet&#8217;s other artefacts.&#8221;</em> Sorry, folks, maybe next time.</li>
<li>Indian newspaper The Hindu <a href="http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/9751">has agreed to stop using the word &#8220;primitives&#8221; to refer to tribal groups</a>. Quote: <em style="line-height: normal;">&#8220;The <a href="http://www.notprimitive.in/">‘Proud Not Primitive’</a> movement to challenge prejudice towards tribal peoples in India is celebrating a major success after ‘The Hindu’, one of the world’s largest English language newspapers, pledged to no longer describe tribal peoples as ‘primitive’. Several journalists from renowned Indian publications have also endorsed the movement, including Kumkum Dasgupta of the Hindustan Times, Nikhil Agarwal of the Press Trust of India, and V Raghunathan of the Times of India.&#8221;</em> Congratulations on this step forward in respect for tribal and indigenous peoples.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-25050676">Should artists form their own political party</a>? Maybe? Quote:<em style="line-height: normal;"> &#8220;In the main hall, a Salvador Dali impersonator acted as the compere as figures from the arts world mounted a kind of pulpit to deliver short sermons on the state of the arts.&#8221;</em> Just so long as they don&#8217;t elect Koons as party chair, I&#8217;m down.</li>

<p><em>&#8220;Permaculture, spirit, and activism &#8211; three very potent tools to regenerate our world [...] I started Earth Activist Training because I wanted a program that could combine them all.  Permaculture is a holistic ecological design system that includes powerful tools that can help us heal damaged land, rebuild communities, and create truly sustainable abundance.  We teach it with a grounding in spirit—personal regeneration&#8211;and a focus on organizing and activism.  In our permaculture design course, students learn how to heal damaged soil, grow food organically, bioremediate toxins, harvest water and re-use graywater, build low-cost, low-carbon housing, and so many other skills.  And most of all, they learn how all the aspects of sustainability can fit together so that we can meet our human needs while caring for the natural systems around us. Permaculture offers solutions to some of our most grave ecological problems. The communities that most need these tools are those who are on the front lines of environmental and social struggles – our depressed inner cities, indigenous reserves where jobs and resources are scarce, desertifying drylands and war-torn lands in the developing world.  To share this knowledge, we need to train people who come from those communities.  They are the best ambassadors and most effective teachers!&#8221;</em> &#8211; Starhawk, <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/support-diversity-scholarships-for-earth-activist-training/x/497880">introducing her new IndieGoGo campaign to fund diversity scholarships for Earth Activist Trainings.</a></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Feri was my first introduction to magic, and I experienced first hand how powerful it can be to open to magical realms. From what I understand, not all traditions deal with the pure electric currents of magic, some are more liturgical. But in Feri, it is desirable to awaken what we call the Feri fire, a subtle electricity akin to kundalini, and which, when ignited, enhances perception greatly. You could say to ignite the Feri fire is to awaken the Ichor – the blood of the Gods – in our own blood, thus greatly enhancing our ability to touch and taste the realms of the Gods. Rituals that don’t open these gates feel flat to me. So, I have this precedent that I strive for as a musician as well. I want to kindle these fires in others with music, to stir and awaken an experience of magic in the listeners. It is every musician’s ideal to be able to captivate their audience and hold them in thrall, and my Feri training has definitely given me tools which enhance my ability to do this.&#8221;</em> &#8211; Sharon Knight, <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/johnbeckett/2013/11/sharon-knight-interview.html">on how Feri has influenced her career as a musician, in an interview with John Beckett.</a></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Be stubborn, don’t expect the universe to explode with happiness and gifts when you start on a professional spiritual path. Make a budget. Make sure you are still giving to your community, and sit down and figure out WHY you want to be a professional with a spiritual practice. If you cannot face the fact that it is a partly selfish endeavor then get out of the running. Be practical. Realize that sleep, making buckets of money, and being able to do what you want to when you want too &#8211; these should be on the list of things you are willing to sacrifice for a while. Give yourself five to ten years to get going. And ultimately, be proud to take the hard road. Humility is overrated, but don’t be an asshole as the pagan community usually does a good job keeping assholes in check and word spreads fast. Remember that you are in service to the people who pay you for your time, energy, objects, or whatever it may be. Do not over service people, and don’t take any bullshit. Do not complain about what you choose. And always do your taxes.&#8221;</em> &#8211; Seb the Shaman, a participant in the Pagan Bundle project, <a href="http://blog.paganbundle.com/post/61793359906/seb">on advice for those who want to make a living doing spiritual work</a>.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;I read a lot of blogs, go to a lot of conferences and festivals, teach a lot of workshops, and have lively discussions with friends related to all things Pagan and Magickal. Although I can say that ease of access to ideas through the internet, bookstores, and Pagan and Magickal events has increased awareness of many social issues, ideologies, religious and theological perspectives, and the vast amount of minutia related Pagan culture and fads, there is an increasing percentage of the Pagan community that is magickally illiterate and innumerate.  I’m not saying that people are less serious, less devoted, or less committed to their path. Nor am I saying that the level of discourse has dropped, in fact in many ways it is much more sophisticated in exploring the development of Pagan culture. What I have noticed is that the technical end of things, magick theory, sacred sciences, and the like, are less well known. I&#8217;ve also noticed a trend towards focusing more exclusively on the lore and mythology of a specific people or a specific time at the expense of a generalized understanding of how magickal paths manifest in a variety of cultures and communities.&#8221;</em> - Ivo Dominguez Jr., <a href="http://witchesandpagans.com/Pagan-Culture-Blogs/paging-thoth-athena.html">on magickal literacy, and the lack thereof, in today&#8217;s Pagan community.</a></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Davidsen&#8217;s critique of Pagan Studies is of a nascent field that has been evident since the late 1980s. Thus it has necessarily been going through a period of demarcation and description, which Davidsen criticises as a loyalist attempt at defining a “pure” Paganism. He also criticises the fact that a greater proportion of work so far has been done by “insider” researchers. In an economic climate where many academic jobs are being cut, with no faculty, department or undergraduate degree in Pagan Studies, it would seem obvious that only those with a deep personal interest would risk devoting time and funds to such studies. But that goes for any field of interest or employment and is not unique to Paganism. Nor does this preclude non Pagans from studying Paganism; it is a very varied area with much scope for development. Scholars of Paganism welcome input from any area of the academy, including from the critical study of religion, to work on developing understanding of religion in all its aspects and manifestations via Pagan Studies, and in increasing knowledge of Paganism itself. However “What is wrong with Pagan Studies?” launches an attack on scholars rather than scholarship. Davidsen uses the foundation built by Michael York and Graham Harvey to dismiss the vantage from which he speaks in few critical sentences. He declares scholars of Paganism en masse to be emic religionists who need to be educated in critical theory, sheltering a cohort of essentialists who are consciously misusing academia as part of a clandestine intra-Pagan power struggle.&#8221;</em> - Melissa Harrington, <a href="https://www.academia.edu/5163312/Academia_edu_davidsen">responding to a critique of Pagan Studies by Markus Davidsen</a> (<a href="https://www.academia.edu/1544410/What_is_Wrong_With_Pagan_Studies">you can read the critique here</a>).</p>

<p><em>&#8220;There is much that Pagans can do in the world, but it will require leadership to do it and leadership is a relationship. Leadership is a two way street. Those who lead only do so because of those they serve. Mind, I did not say ‘follow’. Leadership is inalienably about service, or it is tyranny. Leadership is also risky. For Pagans this danger is acute. Besides putting oneself out in public which inevitably makes one a target, compounded by the isolation the role also produces, Pagans all too often operate by the ‘penguin’ mode of leadership. Penguins, it is said, follow their leaders down to the waterfront and stop before going in. The leaders, at the front of the pack, scan the waters for orca, leopard seals, and the like, which prey on penguins. But the waters are dark and the dangers, invisible. So, the pack pushes the leader in. If they come back up, they all jump in. If only blood comes to the surface, they go swimming elsewhere. Leadership is often about taking risks, but it must be matched by the loyalty of those the leaders serve for it to succeed. Both must be worthy.&#8221;</em> &#8211; Sam Webster, <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/paganrestoration/2013/11/leadership-is-relationship/">on how leadership is relationship.</a></p>

<p><em>&#8220;I remember when cell phones first hit the market. They were supposed to free you up and give you more time. Now, they’re so “smart,” they take away time, allowing addicts to stare at their messages and email in the desperate hope that something important will flash on its screen. I realized that I’d been to festivals and conventions where people had their heads buried in their phones. You could be talking with them while they look and then say, “One second; I just have to answer this message…” If you’re a doctor, that conceivably could be true. Otherwise, you do not own that smart phone…it owns you. Consider this: if your battery had run down, or if the phone hadn’t signaled you with a sound or vibration, and the result was that you didn’t answer that message or email RIGHT NOW, how would your life or the life of the person sending you that note, be different? What if the message to you were delayed by 15 minutes? What about a half hour? Instead, people walk down the street, staring at their phones, missing the world around them; missing out on the world around them.&#8221;</em> &#8211; Donald Michael Kraig, <a href="http://www.llewellyn.com/blog/2013/11/the-magick-destroyer-in-your-pocket/">hits out against smart phones as &#8220;Magick destroyers.&#8221;</a></p>

<p><em>&#8220;The mention of a very specific goddess: Isis. And that goddess, I have no doubt, is in mourning at present, not for Osiris, but for a human woman who over the last nearly seventy years did more to spread the religious devotion to Isis than anyone has since, very likely, Apuleius in late antiquity: Lady Olivia Durdin-Robertson, the principal foundress of the Fellowship of Isis. Lady Olivia was born on April 13, 1917, and recently died on November 14, 2013. She was, truly, one of the most important individual pagans, I think, of the 20th and early 21st centuries, and I think that Isis most certainly inspired and came through her to many others. Sadly, I never was able to meet her, or to get to Clonegal Castle while I was in Ireland; however, a friend of mine did, and spoke very highly of Lady Olivia and of her experiences there in general. May Isis enfold her wings around Lady Olivia, and may she be guided swiftly into the west, with a thousand ushabtis of turquoise to carry out her works for her!&#8221;</em> &#8211; P.

<p><em>&#8220;It’s true that the Pilgrims did celebrate some sort of Thanksgiving back in 1621, and it did come with Native Americans, pumpkin, and probably wild turkey. Unfortunately it wasn’t necessarily a holiday about “coming together” so much as it was about showing off English muskets. In recent years much of the Pilgrim myth has been stripped away. Most Americans are now aware that the Puritans of Plymouth Rock weren’t really the nicest folks. I’m respectful of their dedication to hard work and devotion to their faith, but they weren’t necessarily pioneers of religious freedom. Sure they were interested in their religious freedom, but these were the same people who were burning witches just seventy years later. The myth has always been better than the reality, but I still find value in it. When people reflect on the Pilgrims and the Patuxet it’s a reflection not of what actually was, but what we wish to be. Most of us do dream of a country where everyone can come together to share a meal without caring about race, creed, or gender. Maybe that’s why Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday. It speaks to the best of what we can be. It’s certainly about food and family, but it’s also about coming together despite our differences. I’ll eat a good pound of turkey next Thursday, hug my wife, call my Dad, and watch about ten hours of football, but I’ll also stop to remember what it means to be truly thankful for the blessings in my life, and to reflect on the things that bring us together instead of drive us apart. Happy Thanksgiving.&#8221;</em> &#8211; Jason Mankey, <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/panmankey/2013/11/thanksgiving/">on why he likes Thanksgiving.</a></p>

					<p>In 2010 <a href="http://hendricks.syr.edu/spiritual-life/chaplaincies/pagan.html">Syracuse University’s Henricks Chapel</a> formally appointed a Pagan Chaplain, making Syracuse the second American university to appoint such a position.  <a href="http://usm.maine.edu/interfaith/people">The</a> <a href="http://usm.maine.edu/interfaith/people">University of Southern Maine (UME) set the precedent way back in 2002</a>.  Syracuse was next in 2010 followed by the <a href="http://www.usafa.edu/hc/fc.cfm">Air Force Academy (USAFA) in 2011</a>.  More than three years have passed since Syracuse welcomed Pagan Chaplain, Mary Hudson.  In that time she has accomplished much; most recently, the installation of a dedicated <a href="http://jesusandthegreenman.wordpress.com/2013/10/10/a-stone-circle-at-syracuse-university/"> sacred stone circle</a> in the campus’ main quad.</p>
<div id="attachment_12258" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/syracuse-university-builds-sacred-stone-circle-for-pagan-students.html/3158090070_0146566727_z" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-12258" alt="Syracuse University  Photo Courtesy of Flickr's  rju92" src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/3158090070_0146566727_z-500x334.jpg" width="500" height="334" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Syracuse University<br />Photo Courtesy of Flickr&#8217;s rju92</p></div>
<p>Prior to 2010 Syracuse had already taken steps to advocate for religious plurality and tolerance. For example, <em>The Student Pagan Information Relations and Learning</em><em> (</em>SPIRAL) was a recognized and active student-run group for whom Mary was the advisor. While working for the school’s IT department, Mary assisted Pagan students and was frequently asked to <a href="http://jesusandthegreenman.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/changing-times/">guest-lecture</a> in mythology and religion classes.</p>
<div id="attachment_12259" style="width: 112px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/syracuse-university-builds-sacred-stone-circle-for-pagan-students.html/colemans" ><img class="size-full wp-image-12259" alt="colemans" src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/colemans.jpg" width="102" height="130" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mary Hudson</p></div>
<p>Ironically, in 2009, Mary had made a personal decision to leave university life completely. She recalls:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>I was worried what would happen [to the Pagan students] once I left the University. As it happens, the universe…gods…guides…ancestors…or…whatever had different plans. The Chaplaincy was [established] and recognized with myself appointed to be the Pagan Chaplain.</i></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://hendricks.syr.edu/about-us/staff.html">Tiffany Steinwert, Dean of Henricks Chapel</a>, explains that having a Pagan Chaplain was “crucial to fulfilling their mission,” which reads:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Hendricks Chapel is the diverse religious, spiritual, ethical and cultural heart of Syracuse University that connects people of all faiths and no faith through active engagement, mutual dialogue, reflective spirituality, responsible leadership and a rigorous commitment to social justice.</i></p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_12260" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/syracuse-university-builds-sacred-stone-circle-for-pagan-students.html/download-9" ><img class="size-full wp-image-12260" alt="Dean Tiffany Steinwert" src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/download.jpg" width="150" height="196" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dean Tiffany Steinwert</p></div>
<p>Just recognizing SPIRAL wasn’t enough.  Dean Steinwert stressed Syracuse’s commitment to religious equality.  For that reason alone, all Pagan religions and their chaplain had to be “listed in a normative way.” <i></i></p>
<p>Over the past three years the response to the Pagan Chaplaincy has been mostly positive.  Although there were some initial grumbles from the community, they were, as Dean Steinwert says, “low impact.”  She describes the majority of reactions as “Huh? Pagan?” In her mind this confusion opens a doorway to facilitate greater religious literacy.  It presents a teaching moment. Mary notes:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>I’ve had the sign [taken] off my bulletin board… I get the occasional hate mail or email&#8230; I had a death threat or two in the beginning but nothing like that since then. I’ve talked with many a person to educate them that Pagans aren’t evil devil worshipers. Some believe me; some don’t but that is for them to decide not me. On occasion I get a cold shoulder from a visiting guest but it is due to their ignorance and fear….” </i></p></blockquote>
<p>Despite any backlash, the Chapel and its staff have remained committed to their mission. Mary says, “I have met some of the most incredibly amazing individuals of faith you could possibly imagine and been welcomed with open arms.”</p>
<p>This dedication to religious pluralism extends way beyond the Chapel walls to the University administration itself. Mary explains:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The Pagan Chaplaincy was the only [one] that did not have dedicated religious space on campus. I submitted a proposal several years ago…but that was prior to the Pagan Chaplaincy being recognized. About a year ago I was asked to resubmit the proposal. </i></p></blockquote>
<p>When Dean Steinwert sent the proposal to the Design and Construction team, she expected objections and concerns. Instead she got positive feedback and questions focusing solely on religious sensitivity issues such as: <i>Would Mary have to lay the stones</i>? <i>What types of stones would be needed</i>? <i>Did the stones need to be specially blessed</i>?</p>
<p>The project was approved with relative ease.  On October 14, the school installed four permanent altar stones in the main quad, each representing the cardinal directions.  Coincidentally, while the stones were laid, a <a href="http://jesusandthegreenman.wordpress.com/2013/10/21/convergence-of-spirit/">Native American Student group happened to be performing a ceremonial dance across the quad</a>. Mary says,“[This] is a true symbol of the dedication that the University has to supporting all people in a diverse world.”</p>
<div id="attachment_12262" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/syracuse-university-builds-sacred-stone-circle-for-pagan-students.html/stones-3" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-12262" alt="Syracuse University's Stone Circle" src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/stones-3-500x375.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Syracuse University&#8217;s Stone Circle</p></div>
<p>Syracuse is not the first educational institution to approve a sacred space for Pagan practice. The <a href="http://www.usafa.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123284367">United States Air Force Academy</a> (USAFA) created its Falcon Circle in 2011.  After much backlash and media hype over the $51,484 price tag, <a href="http://www.usafa.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123284367">the USAFA Public Affairs department released this a statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The Cadet Chapel that now houses Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim and Buddhist worship areas cost $3.5 million to build &#8212; in 1959. That would be more than $25 million in today&#8217;s dollars, or enough to build 500 Falcon Circles.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Chaplain (Col.) Robert Bruno, the Academy&#8217;s senior chaplain, was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The First Amendment guarantee of freedom of religion does not just apply to the mainstream faith groups, e.g., Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Orthodox (or) Muslim…It also applies to atheists, secularists, freethinkers and those whose belief systems are usually classified under the umbrella term of &#8216;Earth-Centered Spirituality….A denial of constitutional rights to one threatens the constitutional rights of all. </i></p></blockquote>
<p>Since 2010 both USAFA’s and Syracuse’s inclusivity policies have made national headlines due to both schools’ prominence. This visibility has undoubtedly helped expand the public discourse on Pagan Chaplaincy and Paganism in general.</p>
<div id="attachment_12263" style="width: 130px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/syracuse-university-builds-sacred-stone-circle-for-pagan-students.html/photo-1-4" ><img class="size-full wp-image-12263" alt="Cynthia Jane Collins" src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/photo-1.jpg" width="120" height="120" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cynthia Jane Collins</p></div>
<p>To be fair, it was a much smaller school that paved the way. In 2002 Cynthia Jane Collins became the first <a href="http://usm.maine.edu/interfaith/people">Pagan Chaplain at the University of Southern Maine (UME) in Portland</a>.  She was recruited to assist Pagan students work through their 9/11 grief.  Cynthia resigned in 2013 handing the position over to a trusted Pagan colleague. Of the eleven years at UME, she recalls:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Seeing people of religion and faith work together for the good of all was inspiring&#8230;Everything was not easy, simple or even resolved the thing I think that held us together, and hold chaplaincies in any area together, is the commitment of folk to know other folk.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Outside of the United States, there are several universities with Pagan chaplaincies. These include <a href="http://www1.aston.ac.uk/current-students/health-wellbeing/chaplaincy/places-of-prayer-and-worship/paganism/" target="_blank">Aston University</a> and <a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/ssid/chaplaincy/pagan" target="_blank">the University of Sheffield</a> in the United Kingdom. <a href="http://www.multifaith.utoronto.ca/Campus-Chaplains-Association.htm" target="_blank">The University of Toronto</a> has both Wiccan Chaplain <i>and</i> a Celtic &amp; Recon Tradition Chaplain. Both the <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/multifaith/" target="_blank">University of Victoria</a> in Canada and <a href="http://www.geoffboyce.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/040629Conference_Workshop5.pdf">Flinders University in Australia</a> have had Pagan Chaplains in recent years. (<em>Why they no longer do is still being</em> <em>investigated</em>.)*</p>
<p>Why are there so few Pagan Chaplains in general? Is it fear of backlash or an age-old prejudice?  Mary believes the answer is far simpler.  She says, “Most institutions don’t think about Pagans, or at least haven’t in the past.  [They don’t] understand that there might be a need.”  This may change as highly visible institutions like Syracuse and USAFA continue to recognize Paganism through the support of Chaplaincies and sacred space.</p>
<div id="attachment_12261" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wildhunt.org/2013/11/syracuse-university-builds-sacred-stone-circle-for-pagan-students.html/hps-handfasting-altar" ><img class="size-medium wp-image-12261" alt="Mary Hudson preparing an altar" src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/HPS-Handfasting-Altar-500x331.jpg" width="500" height="331" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mary Hudson preparing an altar</p></div>
<p>Mary has described the past three years as “the greatest experience of her life”- one that she “would never have imagined possible fifteen years ago.” She recalls:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Something a little odd has happened as well with non-Pagan students, faculty and staff…As a Pagan, I’m often the “safe” Chaplain to talk to about hard issues. I have conversations start with “I’m (insert faith tradition) and I don’t want to change, but I want to talk about (insert topic causing crisis in faith) and I thought you would be safe. I don’t want to talk dogma, I just want to talk.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Syracuse’ Pagan Chaplaincy has come a long way in three years.  Mary currently continues to assist Pagan students on a daily basis, to interface with other schools, including the USAFA, and to represent Syracuse and Paganism at national and international Chaplaincy events.  Mary adds:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Most of the time people have no idea how much of an impact they can make in the world around them. It doesn’t have to be a big thing to make that impact, it can be little things.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes those little things can add up to make one big thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>The <a href="http://gallae.com/">Maetreum of Cybele, Magna Mater</a>, which has been in <a href="http://wildhunt.org/tag/maetreum-of-cybele">an ongoing battle with the Town of Catskill, New York</a>, over religious property tax exemptions, was today vindicated in their multi-year struggle when <a href="http://gallae.com/Matreum_v_Catskill_Decision-1.PDF">a State Supreme Court ruling against them</a> on this issue was overturned on appeal. The decision, <a href="http://decisions.courts.state.ny.us/ad3/Decisions/2013/515598.pdf">which was issued on Thursday by the New York Supreme Court&#8217;s Appellate Divsion</a>, says the religious organization <em>&#8220;satisfied the legal requirements in order to receive a real property tax exemption.&#8221;</em></p>
<div id="attachment_9574" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://wildhunt.org/2012/12/top-ten-pagan-stories-of-2012-part-one.html/chnowa" ><img class="size-full wp-image-9574" alt="The Maetreum of Cybele's building." src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/chnowa.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Maetreum of Cybele&#8217;s building.</p></div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The testimony established that the Cybeline Revival stresses communal living among its adherents, as well as providing hospitality and charity to those in need, and the members consider this property the home of their faith [...] They also conduct religious and charitable activities throughout the property on a regular basis. Accordingly, petitioner has satisfied the legal requirements in order to receive a real property tax exemption for 2009, 2010 and 2011 [...] Lahtinen, J.P., Spain and Egan Jr., JJ., concur. ORDERED that the order is reversed, on the law, with costs, petitions granted, and determinations of the Board of Assessment Review for the Town of Catskill denying petitioner&#8217;s applications for real property tax exemptions for 2009, 2010 and 2011 annulled.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a huge reversal of fortune for the Maetreum, which has been fought relentlessly by the Town of Catskill on this issue. By the Maetreum&#8217;s estimate, the town has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal costs, and when the initial Supreme Court victory was handed down to them last year, their lawyer crowed to local press that he <em><a href="http://www.watershedpost.com/2012/palenville%E2%80%99s-pagans-lose-religious-tax-exemption-case">“does not expect much protest from pro-pagan groups now that a judge has carefully analyzed the evidence.”</a></em> Even <a href="http://danadeilers.com/the-maetreum-of-cybele/">some Pagans were skeptical of the Maetreum&#8217;s chances</a> after that decision, but the Maetreum of Cybele were determined to fight on, <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/maetreum-legal-defense-fund/x/497880">and with some fiscal help from the larger Pagan community</a>, they moved forward with their appeal. Now that the appeal has been won, Rev. Mother Cathryn Platine from the Maetreum of Cybele issued the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<div id="attachment_12251" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://wildhunt.org/?attachment_id=12251" ><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-12251" alt="Rev. Mother Cathryn Platine from the Maetreum of Cybele." src="http://wildhunt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1013282_10201319754891831_1847790306_n-e1385179020231-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rev. Mother Cathryn Platine</p></div>
<p><em>&#8220;The Maetreum would like to thank the greater Pagan community for the spiritual and financial help to win this case. It is truly a win for all minority religions setting forth the standard that we Pagans are to be treated in law the same as the so called mainstream religions.</em></p>
<p><em>Throughout this battle we at the Maetreum of Cybele have kept doing our charitable works and recently have applied for a low power FM radio license to further serve our community with true community radio. If we recover our costs that money will go towards further green projects at the Maetreum, continued charitable housing, funding the community radio station and setting up a local food pantry.</em></p>
<p><em>The lessons from this battle are keep true to your beliefs and values and never give up even when it looks rocky.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Rev. Platine, <a href="http://witchesandpagans.com/Pagan-Culture-Blogs/maetreum-of-cybele-wins-on-appeal.html">speaking with Terence P Ward at <em>Witches &amp; Pagans Magazine</em></a>, elaborated on her formal statement, saying that the most important aspect of this win is the ability to, quote, <em>&#8220;just go back to our religious work.&#8221; </em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;If they were trying to erase us, they did exactly the opposite.  Cybele is back in Neopaganism now, as well as ancient paganism.  It will be hard to write about Paganism now, and not include us.  That was part of the larger purpose.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This property tax win, as Rev. Platine intimates, is not only a win for the Maetreum, but for all religious minorities, especially Pagan organizations making their first forays into building a lasting infrastructure of buildings and services. Whatever our tradition or beliefs, our interconnected community owes the Maetreum our thanks for fighting this battle. May they now be able to truly get back to their religious work, unmolested by a local government that thought a small Pagan groups would be easy pickings.
